#.exit
#   Initiates the termination of the Ruby script by raising the SystemExit 
#   exception. This exception may be caught. The optional parameter is used

# .sprintf
#   Returns the string resulting from applying format_string to any additional

# .sleep
#   Suspends the current thread for duration seconds (which may be any number, 
#   including a Float with fractional seconds). Returns the actual number of 
#   seconds slept (rounded), which may be less than that asked for if another 
#   thread calls Thread#run. Called without an argument, sleep() will sleep forever.
